# Usage

This covers how to install and run the program, but not how to develop it.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
1. Open the folder with Visual Studio Code
1. Make sure you have the Java Extension Pack installed

That's it! Everything should work once the project is fully loaded.

## Running in Linux

1. Click the area on the bottom status bar that says "â–¶ Main (calculator-game)" (Select and start debug configuration)
1. Choose `Main`

Tada! That was easy.

### Running in Windows

Follow the above steps for Linux. There may be a warning stating `Build failed, do you want to continue?`. Click `Proceed` and everything should work as expected. I am unsure why this warning appears.
