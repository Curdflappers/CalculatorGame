# Usage

This covers how to install and run the program, but not how to develop it.

## Dependencies

All other dependencies are installed by Maven.

## Installation

1. Ensure all dependencies are set up and functioning correctly
1. Clone the repository
1. Run `mvn` to ensure the project is compiled and functioning correctly

## Running the Project
