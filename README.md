# Calculator Game
A solver for the Calculator: The Game app. It runs through the console window.
Currently it prints out the solution to most levels.

I want to do more.

Eventually, I'd like to:

* Only display hints
* Add a good UI (and restrict bad input)
* Generate its own levels
* Be able to play the game
* Create instructions
* Share levels with friends
