# Calculator Game
A solver for the **Calculator: The Game** by Simple Machine. It runs through the console window.
Currently it prints out the solution to most levels.

I want to do more.

Eventually, I'd like to:

* Support all operators
* Add a feature to only display hints on demand
* Add a good UI (and restrict bad input)
* Be able to play the game
* Generate my own levels
* Create instructions
* Share levels with friends
